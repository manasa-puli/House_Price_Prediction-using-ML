# 🏡 House Price Prediction

This project is focused on predicting housing prices using machine learning techniques. It walks through a full data science workflow — from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to model building, evaluation, and exporting for deployment.

## 📊 Project Overview

Using the Ames Housing dataset, we built a Linear Regression model that predicts the price of a house based on several features like area, number of rooms, neighborhood, and more. This project demonstrates a practical use case for real estate analytics.
